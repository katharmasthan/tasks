    <h2>Why Do I Want to Learn HTML?</h2>

    <p>HTML is the basic building block of all websites. Learning HTML helps me understand how webpages are structured and displayed on the internet.</p>

    <p>It is the first step toward becoming a full-stack developer. Once I learn HTML, I can easily move to CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactive features.</p>

    <p>By learning HTML, I can build my own websites, create my portfolio, and improve my development skills, which will help me in my career and projects.</p>
